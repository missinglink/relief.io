I'd like to start on:

- Building out a browser/mobile layout for the web app
- Allowing people to add POIs (points of interest)

Each POI will have:
- title / description
- geo location
- a set of links (to news etc)
- a set of 'requires' facets
- a set of 'provides' facets

Facets will be things like:
- transport
- food
- healthcare etc

The idea is that when news comes in about a bridge working etc then someone can plot this on the graph. I'd also like to tap in to the foursquare API to let people know when supermarkets etc open.
